# LMS Eureka

Eureka is a REST (Representational State Transfer) based service that is primarily used in the AWS cloud for locating services for the purpose of load balancing and failover of middle-tier servers.

I used Eureka this to register every micro service into the Eureka server and know all the client applications running on each port and IP address
